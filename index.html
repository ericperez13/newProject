            Hello there,
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm Eric Pérez, a passionate web developer with a growing expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've recently completed the Responsive Web Design certification through freeCodeCamp, and I'm continously expanding my skills by taking on new coding challenges. My journey in tech started with a focus on IT support where I honed my problem-solving abilities, but I quickly discovered a love for web development.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm committed to building clean, simple, responsive, and efficient websites that provide excellent user experiences. Whether it's troubleshooting technical issues or crafting engaging web interfaces, I'm dedicated to finding the best solutions. I'm excited to apply my skills to both IT Help Desk Roles and development opportunites, bringing a unique blend of technical support and coding to the table.
