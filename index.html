            Hello everyone,
            <br>
            <br>
            I've debated on making this portfolio over the top with designs and what not, so we're just gonna keep it
            short and simple. I am based in Massachusetts and I have a lot of hobbies so I'm just going to list a few:
            reading, playing video games, pickleball, running, and obviously coding. I've recently gotten into easter
            egg hunting and I MIGHT'VE hidden one somewhere on this page. My challenge to you is: without looking at the
            dev tools, try and find it, good luck :). If you don't want to, I understand, you can keep looking around.
        </p>
