# newProject

# This project is going to consist of me learning about HTML/CSS and JavaScript, but also learning how to use Git as well to push my files into my repo while creating my personal portfolio.

# update 8/19/2024
This repo is going to contain my personal portfolio that I built out myself using HTML and CSS and I will be updating it as my career progresses. I will also be implementing anything I learn via JavaScript and even API's and stuff.

# update 8/20/2024
I added a projects.html files where I will displpay all of the projects I've done. I keep going back and forth on if I should add my resume or not, but I will work on that tomorrow. As of right now, I am stuck on what to do next, while trying to keep things simple, so I'll probably end up putting pictures of the projects and then linking it to my github so they can see source code and all of that.

# update 8/22/2024
I added an images folder where all the pictures of my past projects that will be displayed on my projects.html file and fixed the box where I want to display said projects as well.
