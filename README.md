# newProject

# This project is going to consist of me learning about HTML/CSS and JavaScript, but also learning how to use Git as well to push my files into my repo.

# update 8/19/2024
# This repo is going to contain my personal portfolio that I built out myself using HTML and CSS and I will be updating it as my career progresses. I will also be implementing anything I learn via JavaScript and even API's and stuff.
