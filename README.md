# newProject

# This project is going to consist of me learning about HTML/CSS and JavaScript, but also learning how to use Git as well to push my files into my repo while creating my personal portfolio.

# update 8/19/2024
This repo is going to contain my personal portfolio that I built out myself using HTML and CSS and I will be updating it as my career progresses. I will also be implementing anything I learn via JavaScript and even API's and stuff.

I added a projects.html files where I will displpay all of the projects I've done. I keep going back and forth on if I should add my resume or not, but I will work on that tomorrow. As of right now, I am stuck on what to do next, while trying to keep things simple, so I'll probably end up putting pictures of the projects and then linking it to my github so they can see source code and all of that.

# update 8/22/2024
I added an images folder where all the pictures of my past projects that will be displayed on my projects.html file and fixed the box where I want to display said projects as well.

I've been updating this portfolio everyday, but haven't been updating my README as consistently. I added my project images and added some hover effects, even have some issues that I presented on the issues tab, need to work on those. I changed my bio and made it more professional, really on the fence if to make it professional or make it more personal since it is my personal website. not sure yet, will update.

Added the contact.html file and added some bootstrap icons. Added github icon, LinkedIn icon, and email icon. Need to figure out how to get them side by side instead of stacked on one another.

got my first pull request and I ran with it. It changed everything and now I need to study the new code, but wow does it look clean. I really like the way it looks and I feel like the font I used really makes it pop too.
